        <p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy
            American industrialist who resides just outside of Gotham City. As a child, Bruce
            witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which
            ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek vengeance against
            criminals. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly
            living off his family's fortune, which was amassed through investment in real
            estate before the city became a bustling metropolis, and the profits of Wayne
            Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate.Bruce Wayne resides just outside of
            Gotham City in Wayne Manor. He supports philanthropic causes through his
            nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite. In public, he appears frequently in the company of high-status women, which
            encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, crime-fighting accounts for most of his time</p>
